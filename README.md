Here is how you can run these files from VSCode. 

1) Download VSCode if you haven't. 
2) Download npm. This is important for installing other libraries. These first two steps may take a while (probably 30 min. max).
3) Use the command 'npx create-react-app [desired_folder]' in the command terminal to create a React app in [desired_folder].
Once the folder is created (may take a while), there are four additional libraries that need installing. 1) papaparse (use npm install papaparse in command line) 2) ml-regression-multivariate-linear (npm install ml-regression-multivariate-linear) 3) ml-logistic-regression (npm install ml-logistic-regression) 4) ml-matrix (npm install ml-matrix). These installations should go quickly. 
The CanvasJS files are included in the Git repository. Transport the important files to your local editor by forking or copy-pasting (either is fine). In your React app folder, you will have to replace/modify the template App.js, index.css, index.html, and index.js files with the appropriate Git versions here.
The libraries will either have to be installed globally (e.g. npm install -g ml-logistic-regression in the command line) or installed in the folder that contains the React app (e.g. npm install ml-logistic regression - This is the version used above).
